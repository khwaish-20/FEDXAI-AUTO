Abstract: Background: Industry 4.0’s development requires digitalized manufacturing
through Predictive Maintenance (PdM) because such practices decrease equipment failures
and operational disruptions. However, its effectiveness is hindered by three key challenges:
(1) data confidentiality, as traditional methods rely on centralized data sharing, raising con-
cerns about security and regulatory compliance; (2) a lack of interpretability, where opaque
AI models provide limited transparency, making it difficult for operators to trust and act
on failure predictions; and (3) adaptability issues, as many existing solutions struggle to
maintain a consistent performance across diverse industrial environments. Addressing
these challenges requires a privacy-preserving, interpretable, and adaptive Artificial In-
telligence (AI) model that ensures secure, reliable, and transparent PdM while meeting
industry standards and regulatory requirements. Methods: Explainable AI (XAI) plays a
crucial role in enhancing transparency and trust in PdM models by providing interpretable
insights into failure predictions. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) ensures privacy-
preserving, decentralized model training, allowing multiple industrial sites to collaborate
without sharing sensitive operational data. This proposed research developed a sustainable
privacy-preserving Explainable FL (XFL) model that integrates XAI techniques like Shap-
ley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) into an FL structure to improve PdM’s security and interpretability capabilities.
Results: The proposed XFL model enables industrial operators to interpret, validate, and
refine AI-driven maintenance strategies while ensuring data privacy, accuracy, and reg-
ulatory compliance. Conclusions: This model significantly improves failure prediction,
reduces unplanned downtime, and strengthens trust in AI-driven decision-making. The
simulation results confirm its high reliability, achieving 98.15% accuracy with a minimal
1.85% miss rate, demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable, secure, and interpretable
solution for PdM in Industry 4.0.

1. Introduction
The revolution of Industry 4.0 combines digital technologies to connect physical sys-
tems with electronic manufacturing operations for production. Smart production is the
central principle of this revolution, which connects Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to In-
ternet of Things (IoT) technologies to maintain instant data processing and operational
improvement [1,2]. Organizations need to unify technology with strategic management,
along with human resource development initiatives, to build systems with better pro-
duction efficiency, the optimal resource management structures, and higher competitive
advantages. An effective combination of the components involved creates solutions for
both competition-related challenges and market demands [3]. Major advancements in
manufacturing occur during Industry 4.0 because this stage uses connected technologies
with automated systems and advanced analytical capabilities. Advanced manufacturing
environments make their appearance through the integration of IoT technology with big
data analytics and AI and CPS approaches [4,5]. Maintenance operations under Industry 4.0
deliver substantial effects on productivity, along with enhanced safety performance and
cost management [6]. PdM’s implementation leads to operational enhancements because it
reduces maintenance expenses and minimizes equipment downtime [7,8].
Figure 1 establishes a classification for maintenance strategies through four reliability-
based Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)-centered levels. Reactive Maintenance reacts
to failures through repairs after they happen, which causes equipment stoppages and
expensive repair costs. Planned maintenance uses scheduled servicing for the prevention of
failures while not addressing unpredictable situations. Proactive maintenance helps reduce
defects before equipment failures through proactive measures to enhance reliability. PdM
operates at the highest level through real-time sensor analytics and AI-driven capabilities,
which allow companies to foresee equipment failures and maximize their operational
efficiency across Industry 4.0 fields [9].
 
Figure 1. Maintenance strategies [9].
PdM by the manufacturing, automotive, and aviation industries continues to increase
because it helps anticipate equipment breakdowns through real-time data to the create op-
timal maintenance planning. This proactive method helps decrease unplanned equipment
stoppages while boosting operating effectiveness and device dependability levels [10,11].
PdM optimizes efficiency by leveraging IoT sensor data and advanced analytics to antici-
pate failures, enabling proactive interventions that minimize downtimes, reduce costs, and
enhance safety [12,13].
The PdM process is visually represented in Figure 2, which includes IoT and AI,
along with automation, for the optimization of industrial efficiency. Sensors installed
on connected machines allow for remote monitoring through real-time data collection
to manage persistent equipment health check-ups. Predictive analyses employ Machine
Learning (ML) models to forecast failures, which generate proactive maintenance alerts
AI 2025, 6, 117

for scheduled interventions. Automated maintenance improves workplace operations by
producing maintenance requests, followed by repair scheduling together with technician
allocation, to maintain smooth, continuous production under Industry 4.0 [14].
 
Figure 2. PdM process using the IoT, ML, and automation [14].
The traditional PdM methods encounter multiple substantial barriers even after ex-
periencing important advancements. Hotspot identity and database centralization in the
conventional approaches create substantial risks in terms of information security, along
with noncompliance with rules and regulations [15,16]. Transmission authorities find it
challenging to trust traditional PdM solutions run by black-box ML models that do not
explain their mechanisms or decision processes. The difficulty in understanding how
black-box models work discourages operators from accepting them because they need
transparent explanations for decision confidence [17,18].
ML uses existing data together with real-time data to extract unknown data patterns
which solve challenging prediction challenges [19]. The application of ML algorithms pro-
duces significant advantages by allowing for the analysis of high-dimensional multivariate
datasets while uncovering the elaborate relationships that exist in industrial systems [20,21].
However, the black-box nature of ML techniques creates interpretability challenges, which
ultimately diminishes operator trust in automated decisions because they cannot compre-
hend their predictive reasoning [22–24]. The essential nature of XAI rises to prominence
since it delivers AI-driven models with transparency and interpretability that enhance
operators’ ability to verify and execute actions based on PdM models [25–27].
The traditional ML-based PdM frameworks require centralized data training, which
creates essential privacy risks and breaches of security, as well as noncompliance with
regulations. FL emerges as a powerful distributed AI method that addresses these crucial
problems in existing systems [28]. The collaborative model training process using FL
operates among distributed manufacturing sites or devices to preserve the security of
sensitive raw data while meeting the regulatory standards [29,30].

This research introduces a privacy-preserving XFL predictive model for Industry 4.0
maintenance operations. This predictive XFL model uses FL for privacy protection and
XAI techniques, including SHAP and LIME, for improved interpretability to deliver safe,
transparent, and reliable decisions. This method provides security for sensitive data and
improves trust, as well as adaptability and operational efficiency, therefore becoming an
essential tool for PdM using intelligent methods in Industry 4.0 contexts.
2. The Literature Review
Modern Industry 4.0 developments have motivated extensive research on PdM sys-
tems that implement AI and ML capabilities through distributed computing approaches.
Numerous studies have explored AI-driven PdM strategies, emphasizing data-driven
approaches to failure predictions and reliability improvements. The current research has
failed to properly resolve the problems associated with protecting data privacy alongside
the challenges of understanding models and achieving cross-industry compatibility. This
section provides a critical analysis of the existing research on PdM, FL, and XAI, highlight-
ing their key advancements, limitations, and unresolved challenges while identifying gaps
that need further exploration in the field.
Chen et al. [31] developed the Cox Proportional Hazard Deep Learning (CoxPHDL)
model to resolve the data censoring and data sparsity challenges in functional maintenance
information analyses. A combination of reliability optimization technology and deep
learning resulted in better predictive outcomes for their developed method, according to
the researchers. The autoencoder applied the first processing step of converting nominal
data into a structured form, thus improving the reliability of the maintenance information.
The researchers employed CoxPHM to calculate Time-Between-Failures (TBF) data for cases
where this information was incomplete. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
served as a predictive tool that processed the preprocessed maintenance information for
model training objectives. A large-scale real-world fleet maintenance dataset was used to
test the proposed model, which exhibited better evaluation results in terms of the Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC). This study
found that deep learning delivers effective PdM results yet emphasized the demand for
better explanation methods and privacy protection solutions due to their importance to
industrial deployment.
Cheng et al. [32] introduced a Building Information Modeling (BIM) and IoT-based
PdM framework for Facility Maintenance Management (FMM). Their model was structured
into two layers: an application layer and an information layer. The application layer
included four modules for PdM: a maintenance-planning module, a condition-prediction
module, a condition-assessment module, and a fault-alarming module. The information
layer integrated FMM system data with IoT network data and BIM model information to
build an extensive maintenance solution. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support
Vector Machines (SVMs) functioned together in the prediction model to anticipate the
future condition of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing modules. This research proved
that combining BIM and the IoT makes PdM possible, yet issues of real-time adaptability,
data privacy, and model interpretation require solutions.
A PdM structure for nuclear infrastructure was developed in [33], which merged ML
algorithms with performance anomaly detection methods. This study evaluated infrequent
nuclear structure failures through the execution of Logistic Regression (LR) and SVM
analytical methods. The SVM demonstrated a superior accuracy when compared to that
of LR based on the evaluation metrics. A parameter optimization process was used to
boost the predictive strength of each algorithm. Research was conducted on an extensive
dataset while the developers formulated a new model for linking nuclear infrastructure
AI 2025, 6, 117

data because of its challenging low-probability-density distributions. This study demon-
strates how ML-based PdM performs effectively in tough, high-risk operational settings,
although the researchers need to boost the model’s scalability and reliability for actual
deployment systems.
Zenisek et al. [34] proposed a Random Forest (RF)-based ML model for detecting
concept drift in continuous data streams, aiming to identify wear, tear, and eventual failure
in industrial machinery. This model evaluated real-time sensor inputs to detect developing
faults that might cause system breakdowns. The new procedure demonstrated its capa-
bility to minimize both operational and material expenses while maximizing operational
efficiency. Building robust computational models demands both thoroughly checked and
cleaned data of a superior quality, according to the study’s findings. This research de-
veloped a new method for discovering drift concepts from streaming data that enabled
the early detection of system malfunctioning. The synthetic data tests demonstrated the
PdM capabilities of the model while confirming challenges with authentic data quality
and adaptability.
Research studies [35–37] demonstrate how FL combined with Blockchain and the
Industrial IoT (IIoT) enhances the PdM capabilities of Industry 4.0. The FL framework
allows different parties to jointly develop ML models independently from each other while
preserving confidential data, thus securing distributed industrial systems. The imple-
mentation of Blockchain technologies produces systems that generate transparent data
maintenance records, which both preserve the data’s integrity and prevent any unautho-
rized modifications. Industrial IoT sensors use their ability to detect hidden mechanical
problems through real-time equipment condition data, which they transform into unusual
energy consumption readings. These technologies combine integrated features to create
advanced PdM systems to solve key data security needs, as well as meeting the privacy re-
quirements and system reliability needs. Optimization of their computational performance
and their real-world execution require further research to achieve smooth deployments of
combined solutions.
The researchers in [38] established two main interpretability approaches: local in-
terpretations and global explanations. The interpretation system called LIME, together
with SHAP, explains ML predictions in an agnostic manner and shows users how their
models make choices for individual predictions. Global interpretability methods reveal
complete model patterns to demonstrate how different features generate predictions in
every portion of a dataset. Deep learning models have identified distinct interpretation
approaches, such as Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and at-
tention mechanisms that highlight which input areas drive the model decisions because
these systems demonstrate high complexity. This classification demonstrates why XAI
techniques must be used in PdM to ensure transparency and AI’s trustworthiness while
addressing industrial obstacles to adoption.
Biswal and Sabareesh [39] developed a bench-top test rig for studying the vibration
signatures of critical components in wind turbines, simulating the real-world operational
conditions for condition monitoring. The research process collected vibration data from
regular and faulty components before utilizing an ANN-based model which could dis-
tinguish healthy from defective components. The created ANN model showed a 92.6%
accuracy rate, which proved its capability to detect turbine component defects. Additional
research is needed to solve two fundamental issues with AI-driven vibration analysis mod-
els: their scalability to operational environments and their standardized fault identification
performance for real-world situations.

The data-based diagnostics and prognostics by Xiang et al. [40] improved machine
performance and cut down maintenance expenses. Accurate supervised learning data
labeling took place through serial number comparisons between target components across
consecutive dates. Using real-world vending machine data, this study validated three
different classifiers: SVM, RF, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs). Additionally, two
PdM models were introduced—one for diagnostics and another for two-stage prognostics.
The diagnostics system achieved a greater than 80% accuracy when applied through cross-
validation tests, and the GBM models displayed enhanced effectiveness compared to that
of the standard prediction systems. This study proved that ML maintains its predictive
abilities despite needing properly tagged data along with optimized models to achieve
practical success.
Huuhtanen and Jung [41] developed a deep-learning-based PdM model for photo-
voltaic (PV) panels, employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to monitor the
operational performance. The proposed model predicted the PV panel electrical power
curves by evaluating neighboring panel power outputs. The model found indicators of po-
tential system failures by comparing its estimated power curves with actual measurements.
Numerous experiments showed that the system successfully identified the actual power
curves found in working PV panels while performing better than average interpolation
methods. This work shows how CNN-driven fault detection achieves a high performance
for renewable energy infrastructure, but additional research should focus on scalability
solutions for its industrial real-world deployment.
Table 1 includes a comparative analysis that demonstrates PdM methods through an
analysis of the ML models, preprocessing methods, and predictive techniques used. The
majority of the research lacks privacy-protected methods and interpretability capabilities
for AI systems, thus preventing the development of trust and exposing data security
issues. Several studies demonstrate real-time monitoring, while this capability remains
a difficult barrier to overcome. Future research must address the four main areas where
ML-driven PdM models bring improvements: fault detection, scalability, privacy, and
interpretability capabilities.

3. Limitations of Previous Research Works
The analysis of the previous research in PdM highlights several critical limitations that
need to be addressed:
3.1. A Lack of Privacy-Preserving Techniques
Without incorporating FL or alternative privacy-preserving methods, multiple stud-
ies [31–34,38–41] have faced limitations regarding data security in industrial applica-
tions. The lack of FL requires centralized sharing of sensitive operational data, which
increases security breach risks, together with noncompliance risks concerning strict data
protection legislation.
3.2. A Lack of Explainability and Interpretability
Most PdM models [31–34,39–41] lack XAI techniques, making their decision-making
processes opaque. This lack of interpretability reduces trust in AI-driven predictions,
making it difficult for industry professionals to understand models’ reasoning, validate the
results, and ensure transparency in critical maintenance decisions.
3.3. Limited Real-Time Processing and Scalability
Several studies [31,33,34,39–41] have faced challenges in real-time processing, limiting
their applicability in dynamic industrial environments. Many models require high com-
putational resources or lack the adaptability to scale across multiple industrial settings,
hindering their practical implementation for PdM in Industry 4.0.
4. Contributions to the Proposed Work
The proposed privacy-preserving XFL model for PdM addresses the key limitations
identified in prior research:
4.1. The Incorporation of FL for Data Privacy
Unlike previous works, the proposed model integrates FL to enable secure, decen-
tralized training without sharing raw data. This approach ensures regulatory compli-
ance, data confidentiality, and robust cybersecurity, overcoming the privacy concerns
seen in [31–34,39–41].
4.2. Enhanced Model Interpretability with XAI
To improve the transparency and trust in PdM decisions, the proposed model leverages
XAI techniques such as SHAP and LIME. By making AI-driven insights more understand-
able, this contribution mitigates the lack of interpretability and allows maintenance staff
to verify root causes, prioritize repairs, and make timely decisions, directly enhancing the
operational confidence and safety seen in studies like [31–34,39–41].
4.3. Real-Time Processing and Scalable Industrial Deployment
The proposed framework is designed for real-time PdM and adaptive learning, making
it highly scalable across various industrial sectors. By addressing the real-time limitations
observed in [31–34,39–41], the model ensures fast, data-driven decision-making, reducing
downtimes and optimizing PdM strategies.
5. The Proposed Model
PdM in Industry 4.0 faces key challenges, including data privacy risks, a lack of
interpretability, and real-time adaptability. Traditional centralized ML models require
data sharing across sites, raising security and compliance concerns. Additionally, the
lack of explainability in AI predictions limits trust and decision validation. While the
AI 2025, 6, 117
10 of 24
conventional rule-based analytics and statistical models offer partial solutions, they struggle
with scalability and adaptability in complex industrial environments.
To enhance the predictive performance in Industry 4.0, this research proposes a privacy-
preserving XFL model, integrating FL for secure, decentralized training and XAI techniques
(SHAP, LIME) for transparent decision-making. The model delivers real-time fault identifi-
cations alongside adaptive learning capabilities, and it allows for flexible scalability, which
resolves crucial problems related to data privacy, as well as interpretation requirements and
regulatory requirements. This enables proactive maintenance actions and reduces costly
downtimes by guiding technicians through model-backed alerts with interpretable risk
factors. Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 11 illustrate the PdM process, showcasing decen-
tralized learning at the local server level for data privacy and aggregated updates at the
global server level to enhance the predictive accuracy across industrial sites. Together, these
figures showcase the XFL model’s ability to improve the predictive performance while
maintaining security, transparency, and scalability in Industry 4.0.

Figure 3 shows the PdM pipeline in Industry 4.0, where sensor data, such as process
temperature, rotational speed, torque, tool wear, and air temperature, flow through the
data input layer before their transmission to a central server for analysis. The model passes
through a three-stage processing framework: preprocessing (cleaning and structuring
the sensor data), processing (applying PdM models), and postprocessing (finalizing the
data for validation). The trained data are then sent to the cloud computing infrastructure,
where real-time inputs enable accurate maintenance predictions. This predictive framework
ensures proactive maintenance, reducing downtimes and optimizing machine reliability
across industrial applications.
Figure 4 provides an abstract view of the proposed XFL-based PdM model at the
local server level. The process begins at the data input layer, where the industrial sensor
dataset [42] is collected from the operational parameters. Table 2 shows the features of
the dataset.

These raw data undergo multiple transformations within the preprocessing layer,
which includes data loading, an exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, feature
selection, categorical encoding, and feature scaling, ensuring the data are structured and
optimized for learning.
Preprocessing involves removing multicollinear and high-cardinality features, fol-
lowed by one-hot encoding for categorical variables and Min–Max scaling for nu-
meric attributes.
This ensures the model’s stability and faster convergence during
federated training.
Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of key PdM parameters, highlighting the vari-
ations in machine behavior. Air and process temperature exhibit multi-modal patterns;
rotational speed is right-skewed; torque follows a normal distribution; and tool wear is
left-skewed. The overlaid KDE curves (red lines) provide deeper insights into the prob-
ability distributions, aiding in feature selection and anomaly detection for an optimized
PdM system.
Figure 6 presents box plots and rug plots for key PdM parameters, analyzing their
relationship with machine failures (0 = No Failure, 1 = Failure). The box plots highlight
the distribution, the median, and the presence of outliers, while the rug plots show the
density of data along the x-axis. Rotational speed and torque exhibit significant outliers,
indicating variability in the machine conditions. Tool wear shows a wider range, with
failures occurring across different wear levels. These insights help identify anomalies and
thresholds crucial for PdM models.

Figure 7 presents a heatmap analysis displaying the correlation between key PdM
parameters. The color intensity represents the correlation strength, where values close
to 1 indicate a strong positive correlation, and values near −1 show a strong negative
correlation. Air temperature and process temperature exhibit a high positive correlation
(0.88), suggesting their interdependence. In contrast, rotational speed and torque have a
strong negative correlation (−0.88), indicating an inverse relationship. The other parameters

show weak correlations, meaning they influence machine behavior independently. These
insights help in the feature selection and model optimization for PdM.

Figure 8 presents a comprehensive hexbin analysis of the key PdM parameters, show-
casing their pairwise relationships. Air temperature and process temperature exhibit a
strong positive correlation, while rotational speed and torque demonstrate a clear inverse
relationship, confirming their interdependence. Other feature pairs, such as tool wear vs.
torque and process temperature vs. rotational speed, display scattered distributions, indi-
cating weak or non-linear dependencies. This visualization helps identify highly correlated
features for feature selection and model optimization in PdM.

Figure 9 presents a heatmap analysis of the distribution of machine failures across
different machine types (H, M, L), where H-type machines show the lowest failure rates
(21 out of 1003), M-type machines have moderate failures (83 out of 2997), and L-type
machines exhibit the highest failures (235 out of 6000), indicating greater vulnerability.
The “All” row summarizes the total failures, confirming that L-type machines are at the
highest risk, making them a key target for PdM strategies to reduce breakdowns and
improve reliability.
Figure 9. Machine failure distribution across different types, highlighting high-risk categories for PdM.
Figure 10 presents a bar chart analyzing the primary reasons behind machine failures.
The most common failure type is Heat Dissipation Failure (112 occurrences), indicating
overheating as a major issue. Power Failure follows, suggesting electrical instability is
a significant concern. Overstrain Failure and Tool Wear Failure also contribute notably,
highlighting mechanical stress and component degradation. Random Failures are the
least frequent, implying that most failures have identifiable causes. These insights help in
prioritizing maintenance strategies to mitigate the most critical failure risks.

The processed dataset is then split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets, enabling
model development and validation. The training set is used to develop local server models,
where processed data are utilized to train ML models for PdM. If the local models meet
the accuracy thresholds, the predictions proceed to the cloud computing infrastructure,
where real-time data inputs refine and enhance the model’s reliability further. The system
AI 2025, 6, 117

continuously imports cloud data for further validation, ensuring adaptive learning. Finally,
based on the predictive confidence levels, maintenance actions are triggered, allowing for
proactive intervention before failures occur.
While local models efficiently process machine sensor data for PdM, their effectiveness
is further enhanced by global model aggregation, where insights from multiple industrial
sites are synchronized for improved fault detection accuracy. Figures 4 and 11 illustrate the
local server–client interaction, where each industrial site trains ML models independently
before integrating into the federated PdM framework. Table 3 outlines the pseudocode
detailing the step-by-step process, from the data collection and preprocessing to predictive
modeling, validation, and synchronization with the global model.

Figure 11 illustrates the proposed XFL workflow for PdM in Industry 4.0. In this
approach, multiple industrial sites (Industry 1 to Industry N) independently train the local
ML models using their respective sensor data while preserving privacy. Each industrial
site processes the data through three key layers:
•
The Input Layer: Collects real-time sensor data such as temperature, torque, rotational
speed, and tool wear;
•
The Preprocessing Layer: Applies feature engineering, normalization, encoding, and
scaling to prepare data for training;
•
The Application Layer: Trains a local PdM model for failure detection.
Once the local models are trained, they are sent to the global cloud server, where a fed-
erated aggregation mechanism updates the global model without exposing raw industrial
data. However, while the raw data remain localized, no formal cryptographic mechanisms,
such as Differential Privacy or Secure Aggregation, are applied in this version. The local
model updates Wt
i are computed as
W(t+1)
i
= Wt
i −η∇L
 Wt
i −Di

(1)
where Wt
i represents the model weights at iteration t, η is the learning rate, and
∇L
 Wt
i −Di

is the gradient of the loss function L concerning the local dataset Di.
Each trained local model sends only its weight updates to the global model. The
server aggregates the models by selecting the best-performing local model, based on its
evaluation score:
W* = arg max
Wi
A(Wi, Vi)
(2)
where W* represents the aggregated global model, chosen based on the performance
A(Wi, Vi) of each local model Wi on its validation dataset Vi. If the performance threshold
τ is not met, local clients retrain their models with adjusted hyperparameters to improve
the overall global accuracy.
A performance-based aggregation strategy was used, where the best-performing local
model updated the global model in each round. This choice was driven by the presence
of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across industrial clients,
where averaging techniques such as FedAvg and FedProx may have introduced gradient
noise and reduced the generalization performance. Although a formal convergence proof is
beyond the scope of this study, the empirical evidence from the simulation results demon-
strates stable convergence across rounds without oscillation or divergence. Additionally,
early stopping and validation-based thresholds were applied at the local client level to
prevent overfitting and ensure stable training before model updates were shared with the
global server.
While the feature space and the data partitioning remained consistent across all clients
(70:30), the local data distributions varied in terms of the frequency of failure types or oper-
ational conditions. Therefore, the model selection was based on the validation performance
to ensure generalization and minimize representational bias during aggregation.
To ensure transparency and interpretability, XAI techniques such as SHAP and LIME
are integrated. SHAP and LIME were chosen for their complementary strengths—SHAP
offers global, model-agnostic explanations with consistent feature attribution, while LIME
provides local interpretability for instance-level decisions. This combination meets PdM
operators’ needs for both system-wide transparency and actionable insights. Other XAI
AI 2025, 6, 117
17 of 24
methods (e.g., Grad-CAM, attention) were considered but are better suited to visual data
rather than industrial tabular inputs. SHAP calculates the feature importance values using
ϕj = ∑S⊆F\{j}
|S|!(| F | −| S | −1)!
| F |!
[ f (S ∪{j}) −f (S)]
(3)
where ϕj is the SHAP value for the feature j, F is the feature set, and f (S) represents
the model output when using only a subset S. LIME, on the other hand, explains the
predictions by approximating the global model f (x) with a simple surrogate model g(x):
ˆf (x) = arg min
g∈GL(f, g, πx) + Ω(g)
(4)
where G is the set of interpretable models, L(f, g, πx) measures the local approximation
error, and Ω(g) controls the model’s complexity to prevent overfitting.
Once the global model is optimized, it is deployed for real-time PdM, where a new
sensor data input S′ is classified based on the failure probability:
P
 f ailure | S′ = f

Wt+1, S′
(5)
If P( f ailure | S′) > θ (the decision threshold), here, θ is an empirically selected decision
threshold, tuned using validation data to balance between sensitivity and false alarms in
failure predictions. PdM alerts are triggered, ensuring the proactive prevention of failures.
This FL framework enables privacy-preserving, scalable, and interpretable PdM, improving
industrial efficiency and reliability in Industry 4.0 environments. Table 4 presents the
pseudocode for the proposed global server–client model, outlining the key steps from local
model aggregation to real-time PdM.

6. Simulation Results
PdM in Industry 4.0 faces challenges such as data privacy risks, a lack of inter-
pretability, and the need for scalable, real-time fault detection. The traditional centralized
AI 2025, 6, 117
18 of 24
models struggle with security concerns and regulatory compliance, while black-box AI
models reduce operator trust. To address these issues, this study implements a privacy-
preserving XFL framework, combining FL for decentralized training and XAI techniques
(SHAP, LIME) for interpretability. Simulations were conducted on Google Colab, lever-
aging its cloud-based computational power to evaluate the model’s predictive accuracy,
scalability, efficiency, and privacy preservation. The implementation used Python 3.6.4
with libraries including scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SHAP, and LIME. All
simulations were executed in a standard Colab CPU runtime with 12.6 GB of RAM, without
GPU acceleration.
The results highlight how XFL enhances real-time failure detection, optimizes mainte-
nance scheduling, and ensures transparent AI-driven decision-making in industrial settings.
The evaluation is performed using a real-world PdM dataset, with 70% of the data allo-
cated for training and 30% for testing, ensuring a rigorous and comprehensive assessment.
The model’s performance is analyzed through key PdM metrics, including the accuracy,
sensitivity (True Positive Rate, TPR), specificity (True Negative Rate, TNR), miss rate
(False Negative Rate, FNR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Negative Predictive Value
(NPV), as formally defined in Equations (6)–(11).

(2000 samples) datasets. The True Positive (TP) values indicate correctly predicted failures,
while True Negative (TN) values represent correctly identified non-failures. False Positives
(FPs) denote cases where a failure was incorrectly predicted, and False Negatives (FNs)

The Hist Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the highest TP (7721) and TN (270)
values, suggesting its superior predictive performance with minimal false negatives
(FN = 8 on training, 27 on testing). The Bagging Classifier also showed a strong per-
formance, with high TPs (7720) and relatively low FNs (24 on training, 28 on testing). The
Gradient Boosting Classifier and the K-Neighbors Classifier performed slightly lower, with
AI 2025, 6, 117

higher FN values, indicating more undetected failures. Overall, these results highlight the
effectiveness of ensemble-based methods, particularly Hist Gradient Boosting, in accurately
predicting failures with minimal misclassifications.
Table 6 presents the performance evaluation of the four different ML classifiers—the
K-Neighbors Classifier, the Gradient Boosting Classifier, the Bagging Classifier, and the Hist
Gradient Boosting Classifier—on both the training (8000 samples) and testing (2000 samples)
datasets. This evaluation is based on key PdM metrics, including the accuracy, sensitivity
(TPR), specificity (TNR), miss rate (FNR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Negative
Predictive Value (NPV). The accuracy values range from 97.3% to 99.89% in training and
97.9% to 98.15% in testing, while the sensitivity remains high across the models, with values
between 97.74% and 99.9%. Specificity shows variation across models, ranging from 62.07%
to 99.63% in training and 69.39% to 93.6% in testing, reflecting differences in identifying
non-failure cases. The miss rate (FNR) varies between 0.11% and 2.7%, while the Positive
Predictive Value (PPV) maintains high consistency, ranging from 99.23% to 99.99%. The
Negative Predictive Value (NPV) ranges from 29.51% to 97.12% in training and 55.74% in
testing, indicating how well the models predict non-failure instances. These performance
evaluations provide insights into the reliability and effectiveness of the locally trained
models, which are further aggregated in the FL framework to enhance the global efficiency
of PdM.

After applying FL, the Gradient Boosting Classifier emerged as the best global model,
achieving a superior predictive accuracy while ensuring data privacy. It performed con-
sistently locally and after aggregation, with strong generalization on diverse and non-
IID industrial data and minimal false negatives. The aggregation strategy selected the
highest-performing local model per round, where only the model parameters—not the raw
data—were shared with the server, ensuring privacy. Its balanced sensitivity and specificity,
further confirming it as the optimal choice for federated PdM in Industry 4.0.
Figure 12a illustrates the application of XAI using LIME on the global PdM model,
where a testing sample is analyzed to interpret the model’s decision-making process. The
left-hand section presents the prediction probabilities, where the model assigns a 99%
probability to “No Failure” and only 1% to “Failure”, indicating a low risk of failure for this
specific test instance. The middle section visualizes the decision boundaries, highlighting
key contributing factors such as tool wear, power, and temperature differences, where a
higher tool wear value (>0.64) increases the likelihood of failure. The right-hand section
lists the feature values from the test sample, showing that tool wear (0.78) and power
(0.50) had the most significant influence. Since this explanation is derived from an unseen
test instance, it helps evaluate the model’s interpretability and reliability in real-world
PdM scenarios.

Figure 12b demonstrates the application of LIME to the global PdM model, analyz-
ing a testing sample to interpret its failure predictions. The left-hand section displays
the prediction probabilities, where the model assigns an 84% probability to “No Failure”
and a 16% probability to “Failure”, suggesting a relatively low failure risk for this test
instance. The middle section highlights the decision boundaries, indicating that a tem-
perature difference (temp_diff ≤0.37) is the most influential factor contributing to the
likelihood of failure. Additional features, such as tool wear (0.40) and power (0.59), also
impact the classification. The right-hand section lists the feature values from the test
sample, confirming the key variables influencing the model’s decision. This explanation
enhances transparency, allowing industrial operators to understand and validate PdM
decisions better.
Figure 13 shows a dependence plot from the SHAP analysis displaying tool wear’s
influence on the failure predictions throughout the global PdM model. The model’s
decision-making process depends on the SHAP values displayed on the y-axis, while tool
wear levels appear on the x-axis. The failure probability sharply increases when the tool
wear value surpasses 0.6. The shape gradient shows the power levels, where higher power
levels intensify this impact. This visual representation demonstrates that tool wear serves as
the primary failure risk indicator, whose strength is enhanced during high-power operating
scenarios, helping technicians develop proactive maintenance solutions.

Table 7 compares the proposed XFL model with existing PdM approaches. While
prior models such as ANN—(92.6%) [39], RF—(95%) [43], and SVM-based methods (80%)
show moderate accuracy, they lack interpretability, rely on centralized data processing,
and suffer from higher miss rates, making them less suitable for collaborative and ex-
plainable industrial use. The proposed XFL model (98.15%) demonstrates a better per-
formance compared to that of the traditional models [39,40,43–48] by leveraging FL for
privacy preservation and SHAP/LIME-based XAI for interpretable decision support, ad-
dressing both the transparency and security limitations of the baselines for enhanced
predictive reliability.

7. Conclusions
The increasing complexity of industrial systems in Industry 4.0 necessitates advanced
PdM solutions to prevent unexpected failures, optimize system efficiency, and reduce oper-
ational costs. Traditional PdM models face significant challenges, including data privacy
risks, a lack of interpretability, and centralized processing constraints. AI adoption in indus-
trial systems poses serious privacy risks, such as unauthorized data exposure and model
inversion attacks. The proposed FL-based approach addresses these challenges by ensuring
that data never leave the source, enabling secure model training across sensitive indus-
trial environments. To address these challenges, this study presents a privacy-preserving
XFL model, integrating FL and XAI to enable secure, decentralized PdM with enhanced
transparency. By allowing multiple industrial sites to collaboratively train models while
keeping the raw data private, the XFL framework ensures compliance with data security
regulations and enhances the predictive accuracy. The proposed model achieves a 98.15%
accuracy with a 1.85% miss rate, significantly improving upon the traditional PdM ap-
proaches. Furthermore, SHAP and LIME ensure the interpretability of the predictions,
enabling technicians to verify outcomes and act confidently.
8. Limitations and Future Work
While the XFL model enhances privacy, interpretability, and predictive accuracy, minor
challenges remain. FL introduces a computational and communication overhead, which
can be optimized through efficient communication strategies. In bandwidth-constrained
environments, this may impact the deployment latency. Variability in the local data may
impact the convergence but could be addressed using adaptive learning techniques. More-
over, although the raw data remain local, the current model does not incorporate formal
privacy-preserving mechanisms such as Differential Privacy or Secure Aggregation, which
future work aims to explore for quantifiable protection.
Further improvements in XAI feature attribution could enhance transparency, particu-
larly in making the outputs understandable for non-technical stakeholders and extending
AI 2025, 6, 117
22 of 24
towards mechanism-level interpretability for failures. Future research should focus on
refining the FL aggregation, enabling real-time adaptability, and advancing XAI methods
for broader industrial application. Additionally, future work will address class imbalances
using resampling or cost-sensitive learning to improve the sensitivity to rare failure events
while preserving the realism of industrial data.
